# Roll Dice App

This is a simple Flutter app that allows users to roll a dice by pressing a button. The app consists of only one screen that displays an image of a dice with a random number on it.

## Features

Pressing the "Roll Dice" button generates a random number between 1 and 6 and displays an image of a dice with that number on it.
The user can roll the dice as many times as they want by tapping the "Roll Dice" button.
The app uses the built-in Dart Random class to generate random numbers.
